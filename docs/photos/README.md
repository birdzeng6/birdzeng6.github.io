# Capturing the Stage

For me, live music is a shared experience. As a photographer, I believe that music is for everybodyâ€”it comes from people and will be delivered back to people. My goal is to capture the raw energy and unforgettable connection between artists and their fans, proving that the beauty of a live show is not just seeing a star, but being part of a bond that uplifts everyone.

This gallery is a personal collection of my work, documenting the moments I've been fortunate to witness from behind the lens.

## Navigating the Collection

To make it easy to find specific artists, I've organized this portfolio alphabetically by name. For Chinese artists, the sorting follows the standard convention of **Family Name first**.
