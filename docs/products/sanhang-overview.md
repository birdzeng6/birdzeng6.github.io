# SanHang 叁行

In an age of fleeting posts and disposable comments, SanHang (叁行) offers a space for permanence. It is the first social network designed to honor the beauty and discipline of traditional Chinese vertical typography. Here, words flow not just across the screen, but down the page, inviting a more thoughtful, deliberate, and immersive connection with the written word.

## SanHang at a Glance

* **A True Vertical Experience:** Read and write from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, just like a classical Chinese scroll.

* **Dedicated to Traditional Chinese:** Immerse yourself in the beauty of Traditional characters, with automatic conversion from Simplified input.

* **Write with Intention:** Posts are permanent. Mistakes are marked with a strikrough, not deleted, fostering a culture of thoughtful expression.

* **Authentic Cultural Design:** From classical fonts to a traditional calendar system, every detail is crafted to honor Chinese heritage.

## A Return to Tradition

The idea for SanHang was born from a personal journey—from the quiet moments spent practicing calligraphy and reading ancient texts. I felt a growing disconnect between the mindful, top-to-bottom, right-to-left flow of classical writing and the rapid, horizontal scroll of modern digital life. I searched for a tool that could bridge this gap, a place to practice and immerse myself in this timeless format. When I couldn't find one, I decided to build it myself, for all who share this appreciation for cultural heritage.

## The SanHang Experience

SanHang is more than just an app; it's a unique environment crafted to change the way you read, write, and interact.

1. **Flow Like Ink on Bamboo**

    Experience a truly natural vertical interface. To read, your eyes travel from top to bottom, and your thumb swipes right to left, moving from one column to the next, just as one would read a classical scroll. This simple change encourages focus and a deeper engagement with the text.

2. **Embrace Timeless Characters**

    All text is rendered in beautiful Traditional Chinese, automatically converting from Simplified input. We’ve carefully selected elegant, classical fonts like Slender Gold (瘦金體) and Wei Bei (魏碑體) to ensure every character carries the weight and grace of history.

3. **Write with Intention**

    Inspired by the permanence of ink on bamboo slips, you cannot delete a post. This isn't a limitation—it's an invitation to think before you write. If you make a mistake or have a change of thought, you can use a strikethrough, leaving a visible, honest record of your thought process, just as writers did for centuries.

## A Community of Thinkers & Creators

Since its launch, SanHang has found a passionate community. We’ve been humbled to receive glowing reviews from users who cherish its unique, Chinese-flavored design. The app has been discovered by:

* **Lovers of Culture:** Readers and writers who, like me, felt something was missing in modern social media.

* **Students & Teachers:** Educators who see SanHang as a valuable tool for teaching and learning the nuances of the Chinese language and its history.

* **Journalists & Tech Enthusiasts:** We were honored by multiple press interviews from reporters who believed a product with such strong cultural roots deserved to be shared with the world.

As one user beautifully put it, they were *"not willing to give a low score even if they encountered problems"* a testament to the community's shared passion for the vision.

## The Journey Forward

SanHang is a living project. My vision is to see it grow into an even more powerful tool for writers and creators, integrating modern technology like NLP to enhance the experience while staying true to its core principles. The ultimate goal is to build a space where influential texts can exist with permanence, like words carved in stone—a true record of our time.
