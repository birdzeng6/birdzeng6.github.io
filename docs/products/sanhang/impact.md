# The Impact of SanHang

When we officially launched SanHang on the App Store on October 1, 2015, I truly didn't know what to expect. This was a niche product born from my own personal passion, and I was bracing myself for a quiet reception.

What happened next genuinely surprised and humbled me.

## An Enthusiastic Community

We immediately began to receive overwhelmingly positive ratings. The feedback was incredible; users said they loved this unique, "Chinese-flavored" product. Even when they encountered bugs or had suggestions, they were encouraging and supportive, often saying they weren't willing to give a low score because they believed in the vision so strongly.

I was also greatly encouraged by spontaneous recommendations from users on social media and Chinese BBS forums. It proved to me that if you build something you truly believe in, you will find others who share your passion.

## Press and Public Interest

Despite doing no promotion, I was soon contacted by two different journalists. They had discovered the app on their own and wanted to interview me. They believed that a product with such strong traditional Chinese cultural roots deserved to be known by more people, especially those looking to understand Chinese language and culture.

## Surprising Discoveries

The launch also revealed new audiences I had never anticipated:

* **Overseas Students:** We found a strong following among students studying abroad who were keen on reading ancient books and missed this connection to their heritage.

* **Investors:** I was even approached by investors who saw potential in the product. I ultimately turned down their offers because I couldn't promise the kind of rapid growth they needed. At that time, I felt that committing to their goals would mean compromising the core vision of SanHang, and I wasn't willing to do that.

* **Educators:** The group that contacted me the most, to my great surprise, was teachers. They were Chinese teachers in colleges, universities, and private institutions, and they all wanted to use SanHang as a tool for teaching—a way for their students to complete assignments in a traditionally immersive environment.

At the time, I wasn't equipped to handle such a large-scale educational requirement, which I deeply regretted. Nevertheless, the fact that so many diverse groups of people found value in SanHang gave me a profound sense of confidence. The journey proved that my personal frustration was, in fact, a shared one.
