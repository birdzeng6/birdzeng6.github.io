# Our Team

SanHang began as my personal vision. As a reader of classical texts and a calligraphy enthusiast, I felt a deep disconnect between the mindful, vertical flow of ancient writing and the fast-paced, horizontal world of modern apps. I searched for a tool that could bridge this gap, and when I couldn't find one, I decided to build it myself.

I designed every aspect of the product, from the core concept and user experience to the final visual design, to create a tool that I personally would want to use every day.

To bring this unique vision to life—especially the technical challenge of a vertical, right-to-left interface—I partnered with a small, dedicated team of part-time specialists who believed in the project:

* **A talented iOS Developer** who took on the challenge of building the app's unconventional interface for the iPhone.

* **A skilled Backend Architect** who engineered the server-side infrastructure to support our community and power the app's unique features.

Together, we were able to bring the initial version of SanHang from an idea to a reality.
